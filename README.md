# CarDekho-Used-Car-Price-Prediction-A-Data-Driven-Approach

## 📌 Project Overview
The used car market in India is highly dynamic, with prices fluctuating due to various factors such as **brand, model, mileage, condition, and market trends**. This project aims to develop a **Machine Learning model** that accurately predicts the price of used cars based on their features.

## 📂 Dataset
**Source:** The dataset contains records of used cars sold on **CarDekho.com**.

**Dataset Link:**https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WtxKHx5uQoFYmAEKNWs0Jdx4jkS-OXDq/view
### 📊 Features in the Dataset
- **Car_Name**: Name of the car model.
- **Year**: Manufacturing year of the car.
- **Selling_Price**: Price at which the car was sold (Target Variable).
- **Present_Price**: Current ex-showroom price of the car.
- **Kms_Driven**: Total kilometers driven.
- **Fuel_Type**: Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/CNG).
- **Seller_Type**: Type of seller (Dealer/Individual).
- **Transmission**: Transmission type (Manual/Automatic).
- **Owner**: Number of previous owners.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a **Machine Learning model** that accurately predicts the price of used cars based on key attributes.

## 🚀 Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most influential factors in price prediction.
4. **Model Selection**: Implementing regression-based models such as:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - XGBoost
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance.
6. **Evaluation**: Measuring accuracy using RMSE, R² Score, and MAE.

## 💡 Benefits
- **For Sellers**: Helps in setting a competitive price for faster sales.
- **For Buyers**: Assists in finding fairly priced cars.
- **For the Market**: Enhances efficiency and transparency in used car pricing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Regression, Hyperparameter Tuning

## 📌 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/car-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the model.

## 📌 Results & Insights
- The **Random Forest Regressor** provided the best performance with an **R² score of X.XX**.
- Feature importance analysis showed that **Present_Price** and **Year** had the most significant impact on price prediction.
